# Drone-Based Solar Panel Inspection

## Overview
Welcome to the Drone-Based Solar Panel Inspection project! This innovative solution leverages the power of drones to inspect solar panels, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of solar power systems. Using advanced imaging technology and data analytics, our system identifies potential faults and inefficiencies in solar panels, ensuring they operate at peak performance.

## Problem Statement
Solar panels are vital in the global transition to clean energy. However, inspecting them for maintenance is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Traditional methods require manual inspection, which can be inefficient and prone to human error. This project introduces a drone-based system that automates the process of solar panel inspection, saving time, improving accuracy, and optimizing the overall maintenance process.
